SINGLY LINKED LISTS
variables of the same data types can be kept in a liner way using arrays
This can also be done in linked lists.
singly linked list is one type that is made up of 2 nodes and can only be accessed by foward.

The first node is a pointer to the same structure and therefore it allows the access of itself.

the structure of a singly linked list is:
a HEAD pointer which points to the first node.
These nodes are made up of 2 nodes which is a pointer to the value stored in the node and a pointer to the next node.
THe terminating node is called NULL
